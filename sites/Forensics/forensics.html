                  <h4>Goals and Intent</h4>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">The goals of NAGPRA that we previously thought is that it is supposed to protect the individuals that are found and return them to their living descendents and have them reburried as they would have wanted. I realize that the act was made with the living Indigenous peoples in mind, but I believe it is more important to protect the rights of the dead in this case, as we know they most likely would not have consented to being examined. They would have wanted to be burried by their surviving relatives. Now doing more research i believe it is so much more than that.</p>
                  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                   <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Although NAGPRA’s intentions were to protect the rights of the Indigenous Tribes and their ancestors, many of its shortcomings were revealed right away. NAGPRA prevented the start of new scientific studies of Indigenous remains, but it didn’t enforce the end of current studies or require museums to determine the cultural affiliation of the remains. This means that museums and scientists had complete say over which studies were necessary to continue, or they could just refuse to figure out which tribe the remains are most closely related to, making repatriation impossible. Another issue was that NAGPRA can only protect indigenous remains on federal land, it has no power over remains discovered on private property. Many believe this is due to it infringing on the landowners rights, yet many states have passed their own legislation protecting remains on public and private property. These legislations were deemed constitutional, so many Indigenous peoples don’t understand why NAGPRA wasn’t expanded to include private land. This causes a problem because, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1978, 33% of U.S. land is federally owned and 60% is private land. Although this is a fairly old statistic, current documents suggest that privately owned land has only increased by one or two percentage points. This leaves over half of U.S. land not under NAGPRA, leading to a vast amount or remains unprotected.</p>

                  <hr>
                  <h4>The Discovery</h4>
                    <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: right; width: 30%">
                      <img src="img/unnamed.jpg" width="100%">
                      <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 2: Taken by Howard Frisk Photography">Image of the Columbia River, where the Kennewick man was discovered</a></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px"> The Kennewick man was discovered during the summer of 1996, when two students from a nearby college tripped on his skull while wading in the Columbia River. They were concerned that they had just stumbled upon a homicide victim and immediately called the police. It came as a surprise when it was discovered that the skeleton was of a 9,000 year old Indigenous man. Once this news circulated, an immediate battle over who had custody of him sprang out of the woodwork. The group that managed the land where he was found, the Army Corps of Engineers, claimed they had authority and stated that they would be making the decisions of this case moving forward. They tried to halt all scientific study, but the coroner argued that it was he who actually had authority, which led to the Kennewick man being placed in an evidence locker until the issue was resolved. Following this, five tribes from the surrounding area, including the Colville Tribe, formed a coalition and demanded that the Ancient One's remains be returned to them for reburial. This then led to a lengthy legal battle between anthropologists and scientists against the Army Corps of Engineers and Indigenous tribes.</p>
                  <h4>The Dispute</h4>
                  <h5>The Plaintiffs</h5>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px"> The Plaintiffs consisted of the scientists and anthropologists that wanted The Ancient One to be released to them for research. They believed that it was wrong for the Kennewick man to be given over to the tribes, as he is one of the most well preserved, practically complete ancient skeltons ever. Their argument was that there was no solid proof that the remains were related to any living tribe in the coalition. NAGPRA only applies to ancestral remains of living tribes, and because there was no undisputable evidence linking the remains to any tribe, or that the Kennewick man was even Native American, NAGPRA couldn't protect him. The anthropologists won with this argument, which released the Kennewick man to scientists for study.</p>

                    </figure>
                  <h5>The Defendents</h5>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px"> The Defendants were made up of the Colville Tribe and the Army Corps of Engineers. They argued that The Ancient One was an ancestor of theirs and that he should be returned to them immediately for reburial, as in a lot of indigenous culture, a body needs to be buried so the soul can rest. However, this argument did not hold up in court as genetic analysis in the 1990's wasn't advanced enough to prove that the Kennewick man was Native American. Although the condition of the teeth and age of the remains pointed to them being of Indigenous ancestry, that was not enough to hold up in court.</p>
                  <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Due to the constant improvement of DNA analysis, the Kennewick man was finally confirmed to be of Indigenous ancestry by the Army Corps of Engineers. It also revealed that The Ancient one was most closely related to the Colville Tribe. This meant that the Kennewick man was, in fact, protected under NAGPRA and was returned to the COlville tribe for reburial. In February of 2017, he was buried at the Columbia Plateau. Although eventually The Ancient One was returned to where he belonged, it took twenty years. NAGPRA was enacted to protect the remains of Indigenous individuals and the tribes they are related to, yet it continues to struggle to help the people it was designed to protect. </p>

                  <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>The Future of NAGPRA</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> For the Future of NAGPRA our hopes are that there is an overall improvement in ethics. In this case, and we continue to see this problem, the scientists just see the remains bones that we need to study. These remains being one of the oldest remains found so far means that it holds a lot of information. People forget about Native American culture because all they see is something to study. Although since this case there have been improvements there seems to be a lack of respect for Native Americans in this case and as anthropologists we tend to look at their culture from an ethnocentric point of view and that is something that we would like to see changed in respect to Native American Culture.
We would also like to see for the future of NAGPRA change to where items found on private property can be repatriated as well. Right now, it is just Federal or tribal lands I think that if it could be culturally affiliated it should be reported no matter if it’s on private property. The last point that we would like to see future improvements on would be that it is for tribes that are federally recognized. It takes a lot for tribes to be federally recognized and feel that if remains or artifacts can be culturally identified to a non-federally recognized tribe then they should be returned to them. Whereas right now it wouldn’t. NAGPRA has made a lot of progress since the Kennewick Man but it would be nice to see it continue to grow in respect to Native American Tribes.
